CycleTrainer-GameController
===========================

Arduino code for converting the outputs of four sensors attached to a bike on a cycle trainer to inputs for driving a computer game. For a demonstration visit [Ma.rkJon.es/projects/CycleTrainerGameController/](http://ma.rkjon.es/projects/CycleTrainerGameController/).

The code is in the format of an Arduino project. To compile the code you will need to install the Timer1 library as described [on the Arduino website](http://playground.arduino.cc/code/timer1).
